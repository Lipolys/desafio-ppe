# Gaussian Elimination for Engineering

Project developed for the "Programming for Engineering" discipline, which reads points on a Cartesian plane from a text file, determines the second degree function that defines it and generates PNG images of the parabola.

## Requirements:

- Gnuplot 6.0 (or more) installed
- TDM-GCC 4.9.2 (Dev-C++ 5.11 recommended)


## To use:

- Clone the repository locally or download the project.
- Insert the points you want to interpose in the text file "points.txt" (follow the insertion pattern)
- Change the constant "LOCAL_DIR" to the location where the .c file is
- Compile the PPE_v4 source code on your computer and run it
- If you want to interpolate more than 500 graphs, change the MAX_LEN constant to the desired quantity.
